# JavaScript Basics

## Javascirpt Background Information
- A scripting lanugage: interpreted rather than compiled
  - Interpreted Language: excecuted line by line by an interpreter (ex: a web-browser)
    - Interpretation happens at runtime; no need for a compilation process before running the program
  - Compiled Languages: the source code is translated into machine-code before the executioin
    
- Higher-level programming language (C is low-level) 
-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language 

-Dynamic Programmign Language (Javascript is a d.p. language)
  - Dynamic Languages are characterized ny their ability to modify and extend their behavior at runtime
  - Features that make Javacript a dynamic lanugage
      1. dynmic typing : variable types are determined at runtime
      2. Dynamic Memory Allocation: do not need to worry about memory management
      3. Dynamic Code Execution
      4. Reflection: allowing progmrans to inspect andmaniupulat ethier own structure at runtime 

# DataTypes + Variables
